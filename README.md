This Task automating the start and stop of Amazon EC2 instances based on a specified schedule using AWS CloudWatch Events, AWS Lambda functions, and Terraform. The goal is to reduce costs by ensuring instances are only running when needed, specifically during weekdays.

Overview
The solution involves:
- AWS CloudWatch Events: To trigger actions based on a cron schedule.
- AWS Lambda Functions: To start and stop EC2 instances.
- IAM Roles and Policies: To securely grant the necessary permissions to the Lambda functions.
- Terraform: To define and deploy the infrastructure as code.

Requirements
AWS Account
Terraform v1.0 or higher
AWS Services:  Lambda, EC2, CloudWatch, IAM.

Implementation Steps
1. Define Variables
Variables allow for the customization of the instance start/stop schedule and the tagging strategy used to identify which instances to control.

2. Create IAM Role and Policy
A role for the Lambda function with a policy granting minimal permissions needed to start and stop instances.

3. Lambda Functions
You need two Lambda functions: one to start instances and another to stop them. The functions should filter instances by the specified tags and change their state accordingly.

4. CloudWatch Event Rules and Targets
Define CloudWatch Event Rules to trigger the Lambda functions according to the schedule.
5. Lambda Permissions
Grant CloudWatch Events permission to invoke the Lambda functions.

USED
Deployment Steps
1. Prepare Lambda Functions: Write the code for the start and stop Lambda functions. Package the code and any dependencies into a ZIP file for each function.
2. Terraform Initialization: Run terraform init in your project directory to initialize Terraform and download the necessary providers.
3. Terraform Plan: Execute terraform plan to review the actions Terraform will perform before making any changes to your infrastructure.
4. Terraform Apply: Run terraform apply to apply the configuration and create the resources in your AWS account. Confirm the action when prompted.
5. Verification: After deployment, verify that the CloudWatch Event Rules trigger the Lambda functions at the specified times and that the EC2 instances start and stop as expected.
Maintenance and Troubleshooting
Logs: Check CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda functions to troubleshoot any issues with starting or stopping instances.
Permissions: Ensure the IAM role used by the Lambda functions has the necessary permissions.
Tagging: Verify that the EC2 instances have the correct tags to be identified by the Lambda functions.
Conclusion
This Terraform-based solution automates the starting and stopping of EC2 instances to optimize AWS costs. By leveraging CloudWatch Events, Lambda functions, and IAM roles, you can ensure that instances run only when needed, following the principle of cost efficiency in the cloud.
Remember to regularly review and adjust the schedule and tagging strategy as your infrastructure evolves to ensure continued cost optimization.
